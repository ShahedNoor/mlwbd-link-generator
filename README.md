## Installation

#### To install the necessary packages on a Windows machine, please follow these steps:

Run the following command to install the required package:

```cmd
  npm install selenium-webdriver
```

#### Ensure that you have an active internet connection to download and install the selenium-webdriver package from the npm registry.

If chromium-chromedriver is not already installed on your computer, you will need to install it manually. Refer to the documentation or official website of Chromium to download and install the appropriate chromedriver version compatible with your system.

### To run this project, please follow these steps:

- 1. Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal.
- 2. Verify that Node.js is installed by running the command node -v. If a version number is returned, it indicates that Node.js is successfully installed on your local or Windows machine.

- 3. Change your working directory to the project folder where the main.js file is located. For example, if the project is in the "projects" folder on your desktop, use the command cd ```C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\projects.```
 "projects" refers to the location where the cloned repository is stored.

- 4. Execute the following command to run the project:

```cmd
node main.js
```

Ensure that you have the required permissions and dependencies, including the previously installed selenium-webdriver package and chromedriver, for the project to run smoothly.

Please note that throughout this process, it is important to double-check your spelling and ensure proper formatting to maintain a professional approach.
